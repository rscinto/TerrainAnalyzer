# TerrainAnalyzer
This machine will accept CSV files from the JMARS "MOLA 128ppd Elevation (3)" layer. Draw your route with that layer active. Then go to the chart tab on the dock. Right click on the chart and save the file as a "yourmission.csv". Place the saved file in the same folder as the python program and run.
