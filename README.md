# TerrainAnalyzer
This machine will accept CSV files from the JMARS "MOLA 128ppd Elevation (3)" layer. Draw your route with that layer active. Then go to the chart tab on the dock. Right click on the chart and save the file as a "yourmission.csv". Place the saved file in the same folder as the python program and run.

Be careful with the MOLA 128pps layer as it is prone to accidentally losing your route. It is best to draw the route with the MOLA layer, then immediately change to a 3D shape layer and draw the route again. 

The purpose of 'modded' is to account for the fact that the 128 MOLA layer is not perfect and in some cases it could be useful to consider that the angle is not as bad as the data suggests.
